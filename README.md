# mg library #

This is the source code of `mg`, a toy graphical engine for the
*"Bistaraketa eta Ingurune Birtualak/Visualizaci√≥n y Entornos
Virtuales"* class of the Faculty of Informatics in San
Sebastian/Donostia.

## LICENSE (DO NOT MAKE PUBLIC) ##

The `mg` graphic engine is for educational purposes **and can not be
made public by any means**. **You will receive a grade of zero (0)**
if you put this software in a public repository accessible to others
(such as github or bitnucket).

## Instalation ##

the following command would do in on an Ubuntu system:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
```

## Build the project (Recommended)

`mg` uses the CMAKE suite to compile the project. In CMAKE, you have
to perform two steps:

- Perform this command **only once**

```
cmake CMakeLists.txt
```

this will create the appropriate `Makefile` files, as well as the
`compile_commands.json` file, which is used by many editors to enable
auto-completion facilities.

- Afterwards, you can build the project anytime by running:

```
make
```

this will create the main executables of the project, namely
`browser_gobj` and `browser`.

- you can clean the project running

```
make clean
```

### Build using makefile (Only use this option if the above CMAKE method does not work) ###

clean the project


- Build the project running:

```
make -f makefile.orig
```

- you can clean the project running

```
make -f makefile.orig distclean
make -f makefile.orig clean
```

## Run the project

Just run the following:

```
./browser
```


Sometimes you have to uncomment this line in `Browser/browser.c`
(around line 446):

```
  // Uncomment following line if you have problems initiating GLEW
  //
-  // glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
+  glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
```
